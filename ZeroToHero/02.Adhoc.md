# Ansible Passwordless Authentication and Adhoc Command

- Passwordless auth is pre-requisite for running ansible
- Ansible inventory is heart of ansible

Passwordless Authentication
-
- We install ansible on control (master) node. We provide instructions to ansible on control node with help of yaml(ansible playbooks) or adhoc commands (CLI).
  - Instructions can be like install app on managed nodes (servers we want to install through ansible). Using YML or CLI we can provide insturctions for ansible to install app on managed nodes.
  - When we try to install app on worker using CPI or yml playbook, it will not take our instructions as it will need authentication, be it any VM, Physical server, instance (public, private). Its not possible to talk to physical or VM without authentication

- 2 ways of authentication :- SSH keys and Passwords
  - We can have public key setup on our target (worker) VMs and using private key we can talk to them
  - While running ansible, we cant provide password/key everytime for each VM as we're not doing automation.
  - Instead we can setup prerequisite as passwordless authentication between control and managed nodes so ansible will directly talk to worker VMs and execute instructions in yaml. So passwordless authentication is pre-requisite for ansible

- Passwordless authentication is a mechanism where we tell the target VM not to ask for password when we get request from source VM. This way we always trust source VM to allow access.

- When from our laptop we try to connect to other VM, it will either ask for password or .pem file(ssh key). Initially for the first time only we need to provide password or .pem file.

** To communicate with EC2 only way is using SSH key (.pem file), not using password

Demo
-
- Lets create 2 instances in AWS which we need to connect from local. For one we'll use ssh key and for other password
- Now use our laptop as control node and these 2 VMs as worker

1. Using SSH Key
- Now we have 2 managed node running instances. Go to local terminal and run below command
- Command :- **ssh-copy-id -f "-o ~/Downloads/file.pem" ubuntu@PublicIP**
- After running the command, we can see passwordless auth is established
- If we run again, we can directly connect to instance
- We can also do using below from 2nd time onwards :- **ssh ubuntu@IP**

2.   Using password
- Go to EC2 dashboard, connect to the instance using terminal of AWS and open below file
- File name :- **sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf**
- It is a cloud init file used to update ssh config which we need to update as **"passwordauthentication" to "yes"**
- After that we have to restart the ssh :- **sudo systemctl restart ssh** 
- Then to create password for ubuntu user, run :- **sudo passwd ubuntu and update password**
- Now logout and run :-  **ssh-copy-id ubuntu@IP**
- From now on we can connect to EC2 without asking for password

# Ansible Inventory

- How control node understand which are managed noded? There has to be a way for control nodes to know what are its managed nodes which is called Inventory
- Inventory is just a file within which we provide user and IPs of managed nodes
- Inventory is written in 2 formats :- Inventory.ini or yml

- To create file :- **vim inventory.ini** of managed nodes and put **ubuntu@IP**
- This file can be at any location on our machine. We just have to pass its location in ansible execution. On many ansible machines, the file is present in form of /etc/ansible/hosts, where "hosts" is inventory file
- If on our control node inv file is not there, go to /etc/ansible and create hosts which acts as inv file for us

- Inventory is heart of ansible as it tells control nodes which servers it has to connect with
- Ansible control node might be used by multiple projects in our organization.

- It is recommended to use inventory.ini file for each project separately and pass to ansible execution

- Execute adhoc command on all servers in inv file :- **ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all**
  - all means all servers in inv file
  - For specific IP :- **ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping ubuntu@IP**

- There can be requirement we dont want to run command on all servers or on one server
- Lets say there are 10 app servers and 5 DB servers. Here if we put all 15 instances in inventory. We can group servers in inventory file as well
  - To just run adhoc commands on app servers, group them in inv file. Called as grouping of nodes

  - Command :- **ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping db**

# Adhoc Command

- In ansible there are 2 ways to provide instructions :- playbooks.yml and adhoc commands
- For simple tasks of one step we can use adhoc commands (tasks like creating files, restart, install which are one step activities)  
- To do series of tasks, go with playbooks

- Syntax :- **ansible -i InvFileLocation -m ModuleName -a Arguments ServerName**
          - **ansible -i inventory.ini -m shell -a "apt update" all**
          - **ansible -i inventory.ini -m shell -a "sudo ls /etc" all**
